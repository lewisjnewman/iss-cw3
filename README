# You will find two folders in this archive, one for a mysql container and one for a nginx container.
# This README file provides you with the commands to get the web application working in the most basic configuration.

# Docker Network

So that our containers can talk to each other, we need to create a docker network:

docker network create --subnet=192.0.2.0/24 iss-cw3_net

# MYSQL

After building the MYSQL dockerfile you can use the following run-time command to get started:

docker run -d --net iss-cw3_net --ip 192.0.2.3 --hostname database -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="test" -e MYSQL_DATABASE="data" --name mysql-server_c <mysql image name>

After running this command, your mysql container will not be configured with a database.
Therefore everytime you start your mysql container you need to run the following command in order to prepare the database:

docker exec -i mysql-server_c mysql -uroot -p<your password> data < sqlconfig/data.sql

This will create a pre-configured database which can be used by the web application.

NOTE: You will receive a MYSQL error if you attempt to run the 'docker exec' command too quickly after starting the container with 'docker run'. Wait for a few seconds so that MYSQL can get started.
NOTE: You will need to ensure that the MYSQL root password set at runtime, matches the password which is in the php files on the webserver.
HINT: Importing your database everytime you start the container is not efficient... Think how you can make this data persist!
NOTE: For information on the mysql image, see the following URL: https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/

# NGINX

After building the NGINX dockerfile you can use the following run-time command to get started:

docker run -d --net iss-cw3_net --ip 192.0.2.10 --hostname webserver --add-host database:192.0.2.3 -p 80:80 --name nginx-server_c <nginx image name>

You should now be able to browse to http://localhost/index.php to view the web application!

NOTE: If you have issues getting the basic setup working, ask for help!
